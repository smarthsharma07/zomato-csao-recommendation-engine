# Zomato CSAO Recommendation Engine

Welcome to the technical documentation for our Zomato Cross-Selling and Add-on Optimization (CSAO) engine. This system is designed to predict and recommend the optimal contextual add-ons (sides, desserts, beverages) to a user's cart in real-time, maximizing both cart value and user experience.

## The AI Edge (Differentiator)

Our architecture explicitly leverages modern Pretrained Transformer-based Semantic Embedding Model to natively solve the unstructured data problem that plagues traditional Recommendation Systems.

Instead of relying on rigid, pre-programmed Database foreign-keys or fragile exact-string matching to map complementary items, our engine passes the cart contents through **`all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (a Sentence Transformer LLM)**. 

This model generates high-dimensional mathematical embeddings of the food items. It understands that "Pasta" and "Spaghetti" are semantically identical concepts without us ever programming a rule for it. By mean-pooling these embeddings, we can capture the "vibe" or context of complex, multi-item carts dynamically, calculating Cosine Similarity to find the absolute perfect cultural add-on in milliseconds. 

This "AI Edge" allows our pipeline to be entirely zero-shot and instantly scale to new, unstructured menu items or restaurants without requiring a single manual database update.
