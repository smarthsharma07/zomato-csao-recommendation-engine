# 📖 Zomato CSAO: The Narrative Journey
## *Building a Culturally Intelligent Recommendation Engine*

Welcome to the transcript and step-by-step chronicle of the **Zomato Cross-Selling & Add-on Optimization (CSAO)** project. This is not just a repository; it is a tutorial on how we moved from a generic recommendation model to a production-grade, culturally anchored engine.

### 🌑 Prologue: The Recommendation Crisis
At the start of this project, we faced a classic "Generic Fallback" problem. With a small catalog (~50 items) and simple logic, the system suffered from:
1.  **Cuisine Hallucinations:** Recommending a MARGHERITA PIZZA for a user ordering BUTTER CHICKEN.
2.  **The "Fries & Coke" Trap:** Globally popular items overwhelmed specific, high-value pairings.
3.  **Low Semantic Density:** The model couldn't distinguish between subtle culinary relationships.

**Our Mission:** Build an engine that "understands" food, respects culture, and scales to enterprise demands—all under a 300ms latency budget.

### 🏗️ Chapter 1: The Two-Stage Blueprint
To achieve intelligence at scale, we adopted an industry-standard **Two-Stage Funnel**:

1.  **Stage 1 - Retrieval:** Narrowing down the 300-item universe to the Top 50 best candidates using high-speed vector math.
2.  **Stage 2 - Ranking:** Using a heavy-duty Machine Learning model (**LightGBM LambdaMART**) to perfectly order those 50 items based on User Segment, Time, and Value.

### 🧠 Chapter 2: Giving the Engine a Brain (Transformer Embeddings)
We moved away from manual "if/else" tags and embraced **AI-driven Semantic Embeddings**.

*   **Model:** We leveraged `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` to turn dish names into 384-dimensional vectors.
*   **The Sequential Breakthrough:** We didn't just look at the whole cart; we cared about the **Order of Operations**. 
    *   *Logic:* We implemented **Weighted Sequential Pooling** (`0.5 * Last Item + 0.5 * Mean of Previous`). This ensures the last item you added carries as much weight as your entire history, making the engine feel "alive" and reactive.

---

### � Chapter 3: Expanding the Universe
A recommendation engine is only as good as its training data. We expanded the synthetic catalog from **50 to 300+ items** across 7 distinct cuisines:
*   *North Indian, South Indian, Indo-Chinese, Fast Food, Italian, Desserts, and Beverages.*

This massive expansion allowed for **dense semantic clusters**, ensuring that if you order a Lassi, the model found 10 other relatable North Indian drinks instead of just "Coke."

### 🛡️ Chapter 4: The Cultural Guardrails
To solve the "Butter Chicken -> Pizza" hallucination, we implemented a **Strict Cuisine Filter (Stage 0)**:
1.  The engine detects the **Dominant Region** of your cart.
2.  It strictly restricts Stage 1 candidates to either that same region OR global entities (Desserts/Beverages).
3.  *Result:* Zero cultural mismatch. A high-fidelity experience that respects a user's culinary intent.

### 🎨 Chapter 5: Polishing for Business (The Final 10%)
Final refinements were added to ensure the output wasn't just accurate, but **profitable**:
*   **Popularity Penalty:** We applied a `-0.1` alpha penalty to global generic items (Water, Coke) to force the engine to discover unique pairings (like Raita or Garlic Naan).
*   **Diversity Constraint:** A hard post-ranking rule limits recommendations to **Max 2 Beverages**, leaving more slots for high-margin sides and main-course add-ons.

---

### 📊 Epilogue: The Outcome
After 12 phases of development, the final model delivered:
*   **AUC Score:** `0.8489` (Strong predictive quality).
*   **HitRate @ 8:** `95.40%` (High-fidelity matching in a 300+ item universe).
*   **Latency:** `~156 ms` (Blazing fast per-request inference).

### 🛠️ Tutorial: How to Reproduce
To recreate this journey from scratch:

1.  **The Engine Room:** Run the full pipeline to generate data and train.
    ```bash
    python run_full_pipeline.py
    ```
2.  **The Proof:** Run the demonstration to see final predictions for various meal combinations.
    ```bash
    python 1_Model_Development/demonstration.py
    ```
3.  **The Results:** Look at `demonstration_results.json` to see how the engine handles complex carts with perfect cultural alignment.
